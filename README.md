# TypeGraphQL JWT Authentication 

This repository showcases a robust authentication system built with TypeGraphQL, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and secure password hashing with salt. The implementation includes role-based authentication, leveraging custom auth checks and middleware for enhanced security.

## Features

TypeGraphQL: Utilizes the power of TypeGraphQL for defining GraphQL schema and resolvers in a strongly-typed manner.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Implements JWT-based authentication to secure user sessions and maintain stateless authentication.

Password Hashing with Salt: Enhances security by securely hashing passwords with the addition of salt, preventing common vulnerabilities.

Role-Based Authentication: Incorporates role-based access control to manage user permissions and access levels effectively.

Custom Auth Checks and Middleware: Implements custom authentication checks and middleware for fine-grained control over access and security.
